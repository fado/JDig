A tool for the automatic generation of LPC class files for Epitaph developers.  See ![Epitaph MUD](www.drakkos.co.uk).

This tool allows the developer to design new areas within a graphical interface.  The developer places rooms and connects them together with exits.  Attributes can be added to each of the rooms including light levels, items, etc., before individual LPC files are generated from the map.

Key features include:

- 2D, layered mapping of MUD areas.
- Automatic conversion of maps to LPC.
- Procedural generation of areas.

Latest Developments
===================

The essential mapping features are in place.  Now working on allowing the user to assign attributes to each of the rooms.  A very early pre-alpha release has been posted to give the end users an idea of the direction in which the project is going.  An early alpha is still a few weeks away.
