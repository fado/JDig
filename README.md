A tool for the automatic generation of LPC class files for Epitaph developers.  See ![Epitaph MUD](www.drakkos.co.uk).

This tool allows MUD developers to design new areas within a graphical interface.  The developer places rooms and connects them together with exits.  Attributes can be added to each of the rooms including light levels, items, etc., before individual LPC files are generated from the map.

Key features include:

- 2D, layered mapping of MUD areas.
- Automatic conversion of maps to LPC.
- Procedural generation of areas.
