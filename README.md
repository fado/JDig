JDig
====

NOTE: This project is ~~not currently in active development~~ dead.  At this time, I am ~~occasionally tinkering with the development branch, trying to switch the entire thing over to JavaFX and de-crufting vast swathes of terrible code~~ ashamed of most of this code and can't believe I'm leaving this public.  This will ~~probably~~ definitely not be an on-going exercise as my real-life schedule continues to kick me in the proverbial crotch.

With that caveat, I present JDIG, a tool for the automatic generation of LPC class files for MUD developers.

This tool allows the developer to design new areas within a graphical interface.  The developer places rooms and connects them together with exits.  Attributes can be added to each of the rooms including light levels, items, etc., before individual LPC files are generated from the map.
